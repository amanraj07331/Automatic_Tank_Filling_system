# Automated-Tank-Filling-System
Developed a PLC-based ON-OFF controller to automate the filling of an overhead tank from a sump. The system uses level switches to monitor water levels, activating the pump only when sufficient water is available in the sump. This ensures efficient water management and prevents overflow or dry running.
